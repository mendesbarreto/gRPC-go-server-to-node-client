# Server and Client gRPC Test

I built this repo to test the gRPC Tech, to experiment:

- How it works
- How to generate golang and typescript code from proto files
- Understand the gRPC workflow and the ecosystem

It's based on [gRPC](https://grpc.io/).

FYI: Use the readme.md files in the folders for more information.
